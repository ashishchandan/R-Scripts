cat( "REFINING THE MODEL AND ANALYZING PREDICTIONS

Recall that we discussed the principle of simplicity: 
that is, a model with fewer variables is preferable to a model 
with many unnnecessary variables. Experiment with 
removing independent variables from the original model. 
Remember to use the significance of the coefficients 
to decide which variables to remove (remove the one with 
the largest p-value first, or the one with the t value 
closest to zero), and to remove them one at a time 
(this is called backwards variable selection). 
This is important due to multicollinearity issues - 
removing one insignificant variable may make another 
previously insignificant variable become significant.
