#AUTOMATING REVIEWS IN MEDICINE
#
#The medical literature is enormous. Pubmed, a database of medical publications maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, has indexed over 23 million medical publications. Further, the rate of medical publication has increased over time, and now there are nearly 1 million new publications in the field each year, or more than one per minute.
#
#The large size and fast-changing nature of the medical literature has increased the need for reviews, which search databases like Pubmed for papers on a particular topic and then report results from the papers found. While such reviews are often performed manually, with multiple people reviewing each search result, this is tedious and time consuming. In this problem, we will see how text analytics can be used to automate the process of information retrieval.
#
#The dataset consists of the titles (variable title) and abstracts (variable abstract) of papers retrieved in a Pubmed search. Each search result is labeled with whether the paper is a clinical trial testing a drug therapy for cancer (variable trial). These labels were obtained by two people reviewing each search result and accessing the actual paper if necessary, as part of a literature review of clinical trials testing drug therapies for advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

#The decision maker for this problem, a researcher performing a review of the medical literature, would use a model (like the CART one we built here) in the following workflow:
#
#1) For all of the papers retreived in the PubMed Search, predict which papers are clinical trials using the model. This yields some initial Set A of papers predicted to be trials, and some Set B of papers predicted not to be trials. (See the figure below.)
#
#2) Then, the decision maker manually reviews all papers in Set A, verifying that each paper meets the study's detailed inclusion criteria (for the purposes of this analysis, we assume this manual review is 100% accurate at identifying whether a paper in Set A is relevant to the study). This yields a more limited set of papers to be included in the study, which would ideally be all papers in the medical literature meeting the detailed inclusion criteria for the study.
#
#3) Perform the study-specific analysis, using data extracted from the limited set of papers identified in step 2.
#
#This process is shown in the figure below.

#PROBLEM 5.3 - DECISION-MAKER TRADEOFFS  (1/1 point)
#Given the costs associated with false positives and false negatives, which of the following is most accurate?
#
# A false positive is more costly than a false negative; the decision maker should use a probability threshold greater than 0.5 for the machine learning model.  A false positive is more costly than a false negative; the decision maker should use a probability threshold less than 0.5 for the machine learning model.  A false negative is more costly than a false positive; the decision maker should use a probability threshold greater than 0.5 for the machine learning model.
